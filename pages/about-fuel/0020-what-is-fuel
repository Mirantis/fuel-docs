What is Fuel?
=============

Fuel is lifecycle management application that deploys multiple OpenStack environments
from a single interface and then enables you to manage those clouds post-deployment.
You can add nodes, remove nodes or even remove an entire cloud and return the resources
to the pool of available resources.  Baked into Fuel are:

- Mirantis reference architectures that weâ€™ve tested and certified to ensure that
your deployed cloud can scale, is reliable and is production quality.

- An open and flexible library that enables customers to make configuration
changes that may be more advanced or focused than the default choices within Fuel.
This library also empowers organizations to fold additional drivers or integrations
into the deployed environment.

Simply put, Fuel is a way for you to easily configure and install an 
OpenStack-based infrastructure in your own environment.
