What is Fuel?
=============

Fuel is a ready-to-install collection of the packages and scripts you need 
to create a robust, configurable, vendor-independent OpenStack cloud in your 
own environment. As of Fuel 3.1, Fuel Library and Fuel Web have been merged 
into a single toolbox with options to use the UI or CLI for management. 

A single OpenStack cloud consists of packages from many different open source 
projects, each with its own requirements, installation procedures, and 
configuration management. Fuel brings all of these projects together into a 
single open source distribution, with components that have been tested and are 
guaranteed to work together, and all wrapped up using scripts to help you work 
through a single installation.

Simply put, Fuel is a way for you to easily configure and install an 
OpenStack-based infrastructure in your own environment.
