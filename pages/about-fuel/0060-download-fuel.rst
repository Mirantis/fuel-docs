Download Fuel
=============

The first step in installing Fuel is to download the version appropriate to 
your environment.

Fuel is available for Grizzly OpenStack installation, and 
will be available for Havana shortly after Havana's release.

The Fuel ISO and IMG, along with other Fuel releases, are available in the 
`Downloads <http://fuel.mirantis.com/your-downloads/>`_ section of the Fuel 
portal.
