Download Fuel
=============

The first step in installing Fuel is to download the version appropriate to 
your environment.

Fuel is available for Essex, Folsom and Grizzly OpenStack installations, and 
will be available for Havana shortly after Havana's release.

The Admin Node ISO, along with other Fuel releases, is available in the 
`Downloads <http://fuel.mirantis.com/your-downloads/>`_ section of the Fuel 
portal.
