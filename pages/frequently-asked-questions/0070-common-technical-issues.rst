Common Technical Issues
=======================

**Issue:**
  Puppet fails with::

    err: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: 
    undefined method 'fact_merge' for nil:NilClass"

This is a Puppet bug.  See: http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/3234

**Workaround**::

  service puppetmaster restart

**Issue:**
  Puppet client does not resend the certificate to Puppet Master. The client 
  certificate cannot be signed and verified.

This is a Puppet bug.  See: http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/4680

**Workaround:**

* On Puppet client::

  rm -f /etc/puppet/ssl/certificate_requests/\*.pem
  rm -f /etc/puppet/ssl/certs/\*.pem

* On Puppet master::

  rm -f /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/\*.pem

**Issue:**
  The manifests are up-to-date under ``/etc/puppet/manifests``, but Puppet 
  Master keeps serving the previous version of manifests to the clients. 
  Manifests seem to be cached by the Puppet Master.

**Workaround**::

  service puppetmaster restart
