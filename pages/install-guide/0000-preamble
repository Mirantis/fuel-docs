In this section, you’ll learn how to install OpenStack using Fuel. In 
addition to getting a feel for the steps involved, you’ll also gain valuable 
familiarity with some of the customization options. While Fuel provides 
different deployment configuration templates in the box, it is common for 
administrators to modify the architecture to meet enterprise requirements. 
Working hands on with Fuel for OpenStack will help you see how to move 
certain features around from the standard installation.

The first step, however, is to commit to a deployment template. A balanced, 
compact, and full-featured deployment is the Multi-node with HA deployment, so 
that is what we’ll be using through the rest of this guide.

Production installations require a physical hardware infrastructure, but you 
can easily deploy a small simulation cloud on a single physical machine 
using VirtualBox. You can follow these instructions to install an OpenStack 
cloud into a test environment using VirtualBox, or to get a production-grade 
installation using physical hardware.
