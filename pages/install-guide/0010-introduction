How installation works
----------------------

While version 2.0 of Fuel provided the ability to simplify installation of 
OpenStack, versions 2.1 and above include orchestration capabilities that 
simplify deployment of OpenStack environments. The deployment process using 
Fuel CLI follows this general procedure:

#.  Design your architecture.
#.  Install Fuel onto the fuel-pm machine.
#.  Configure Fuel.
#.  Create the basic configuration and load it into Cobbler.
#.  PXE-boot the servers so Cobbler can install the operating system and 
prepare them for orchestration.
#.  Use one of the templates included in Fuel and the configuration that 
populates Puppet's site.pp file.
#.  Customize the site.pp file as needed.
#.  Use the orchestrator to coordinate the installation of the appropriate 
OpenStack components on each node.

Start by designing your architecture, details about which you can find in 
the next section, :ref:`Before You Start <0015-before-you-start.rst>`
