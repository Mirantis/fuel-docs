OpenStack is an extensible, versatile, and flexible cloud management platform. By exposing its portfolio of cloud infrastructure services – compute, storage, networking and other core resources — through ReST APIs, OpenStack enables a wide range of control over these services, both from the perspective of an integrated Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) controlled by applications, as well as automated manipulation of the infrastructure itself.

This architectural flexibility doesn’t set itself up magically. It asks you, the user and cloud administrator, to organize and manage an extensive array of configuration options. Consequently, getting the most out of your OpenStack cloud over time – in terms of flexibility, scalability, and manageability – requires a thoughtful combination of complex configuration choices. This can be very time consuming and requires a significant amount of studious documentation to comprehend.

Mirantis Fuel for OpenStack was created to eliminate exactly these problems. This step-by-step guide takes you through this process of:

* Configuring OpenStack and its supporting components into a robust cloud architecture
* Deploying that architecture through an effective, well-integrated automation package that sets up and maintains the components and their configurations
* Providing access to a well-integrated, up-to-date set of components known to work together
