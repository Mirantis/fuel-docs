.. index:: Installing Fuel Admin Node

Installing Fuel Admin Node
==========================

.. contents:: :local:

Fuel is distributed as an ISO that contains an installer for Fuel Admin 
node. The ISO image can be used for CD media devices, iLO or similar remote 
access systems as well as generating bootable USB devices.

Once installed, Fuel can be used to deploy and manage OpenStack clusters. It 
will assign IP addresses to the nodes, perform PXE boot and initial 
configuration, and provision of OpenStack nodes according to their roles in 
the cluster.

On Bare-Metal Environment
-------------------------

To install Fuel on bare-metal environment, you need to burn the provided ISO 
to a CD/DVD, or IMG file to a USB stick, and start the installation process 
by booting from that media, very much like any other OS.

Linux and Mac users can prepare an installation USB stick with the ``dd`` 
command. For example, if your flash drive is ``/dev/sdb``, you can use 
following command line::

    dd if=fuel.img of=/dev/sdb

You can find the actual device name in the output of the ``dmesg`` command for 
Linux or ``diskutil list`` for Mac OS.

On Windows, you can write the installation image with 
`Win32 Disk Imager <http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/>`_.

After the installation is complete, you will need to allocate bare-metal 
nodes for your OpenStack cluster, put them on the same L2 network as the 
admin node, and PXE boot. The UI will discover them and make them available 
for installing OpenStack.

On VirtualBox
-------------

If you are going to evaluate Fuel on VirtualBox, you should know that we 
provide a set of scripts that create and configure all of the required VMs 
for you, including the admin node and slave nodes for OpenStack itself. It's 
a very simple, single-click installation.  

.. note:: These scripts are not supported on Windows, but you can still test on 
    VirtualBox by creating the VMs yourself. See "Manual Mode" for more 
    information.

The requirements for running Fuel on VirtualBox are:

* A host machine with Linux or Mac OS.

  * The scripts have been tested on Mac OS 10.7.5, Mac OS 10.8.3, and Ubuntu 
  12.04.

* VirtualBox must be installed with the extension pack. Both can be downloaded 
  from `<http://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.

  * The scripts have been tested using VirtualBox 4.2.12

* 8 GB+ of RAM

  * to handle 4 VMs for non-HA OpenStack installation (1 admin node, 1 
  controller node, 1 compute node, 1 cinder node)
 
  * to handle 5 VMs for HA OpenStack installation (1 admin node, 3 controller 
    nodes, 1 compute node)

Automatic mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you unpack the scripts, you will see the following important files and 
folders:

* iso

  * This folder needs to contain a single ISO image for Fuel. Once you 
    download ISO from the portal, copy or move it into this directory

* config.sh

  * This file contains configuration, which can be fine-tuned. For example, 
  you can select how many virtual nodes to launch, as well as how much 
  memory to give them.

* launch.sh

  * Once executed, this script will pick up an image from the ``iso`` directory,
	create a VM, mount the image to this VM, and automatically install the 
	admin node.

  * After installation of the admin node, the script creates slaves for 
  OpenStack and PXE-boots them from the admin node.

  * Finally, the script gives you the link to access the Web-based UI for the 
    admin node so you can start installation of an OpenStack cluster.

Here is the example config file, with the values that you can adjust:

.. literalinclude:: /_static/config.sh
   :language: bash
   :linenos:

Manual mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you cannot or would rather not run the convenience scripts, you can still 
run Fuel on VirtualBox by following these steps.

Admin node deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, create the admin node.

1. Configure the host-only interface vboxnet0 in VirtualBox.

  * IP address: 10.20.0.1
  * Interface mask: 255.255.255.0
  * DHCP disabled

2. Create a VM for the admin node with the following parameters:

  * OS Type: Linux, Version: Red Hat (64bit)
  * RAM: 1024 MB
  * HDD: 16 GB, with dynamic disk expansion
  * CDROM: mount iso installer
  * Network 1: host-ony interface vboxnet0

3. Power on the VM in order to start the installation.

4. Wait for the welcome message with all information needed to login into 
the UI of Fuel.

Adding slave nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, create nodes on which to install OpenStack.

1. Create VMs with the following parameters:

* OS Type: Linux, Version: Red Hat (64bit)
* RAM: 768 MB
* HDD: 16 GB, with dynamic disk expansion
* Network 1: host-only interface vboxnet0, PCnet-FAST III device

2. Set priority for the network boot:

.. image:: /_images/vbox-image1.png

3. Configure the network adapter on each VM:

.. image:: /_images/vbox-image2.png

Changing network parameters
---------------------------

You can change the network settings for the admin (PXE booting) network, which 
is 10.20.0.2/24 gw 10.20.0.1 by default.

In order to do so, press the <TAB> key Ð°t the very first installation screen 
which says "Welcome to FuelWeb Installer!" and update the kernel options. For 
example, to use 192.168.1.10/24 IP address for the master node and 192.168.1.1 
as the gateway and DNS server you should change the parameters to those shown 
in the image below:

.. image:: /_images/network-at-boot.png

When you're finished making changes, press the Enter key and wait for the 
installation to complete.

Changing network parameters after booting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

	Once IP settings are set at the boot time for Fuel master node, it 
	**must not be changed during the whole lifecycle of Fuel.**

It is still possible to configure other interfaces, or add 802.1Q 
subinterfaces to the Fuel to be able to access it from office network if 
required. It is easy to do via standard network configuration scripts for 
CentOS. When the installation is complete, you can modify 
``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth\*`` scripts. For example, if 
*eth1* interface is on the L2 network which is planned for PXE booting, and 
*eth2* is the interface connected to office network switch, *eth0* is not in 
use, then settings can be the following:

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0::

  DEVICE=eth0
  ONBOOT=no

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1::

  DEVICE=eth1
  ONBOOT=yes
  HWADDR=<your MAC>
  ..... (other settings in your config) .....
  PEERDNS=no
  BOOTPROTO=static
  IPADDR=192.168.1.10
  NETMASK=255.255.255.0

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth2::

  DEVICE=eth2
  ONBOOT=yes
  HWADDR=<your MAC>
  ..... (other settings in your config) .....
  PEERDNS=no
  IPADDR=172.18.0.5
  NETMASK=255.255.255.0

After modification of network configuration files, it is required to apply the 
new configuration::

  service network restart

Now you should be able to connect to Fuel UI from the office network
via `<http://172.18.0.5:8000/>`_

Name resolution (DNS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During admin node installation, it is assumed that there is a recursive DNS 
service on 10.20.0.1.

If you want to make it possible for slave nodes to be able to resolve public 
names, you need to change this default value to point to an actual DNS 
service. To make the change, run the following command on Fuel node (replace 
IP to your actual DNS)::

  echo "nameserver 172.0.0.1" > /etc/dnsmasq.upstream

PXE booting settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, eth0 on Fuel admin node serves PXE requests. If you are planning 
to use another interface, then it is required to modify dnsmasq settings 
(which acts as DHCP server). Edit the file /etc/cobbler/dnsmasq.template, 
find the line ``"interface=eth0"`` and replace the interface name with the 
one you want to use. Launch command to synchronize cobbler service 
afterwards::

  cobbler sync

During synchronization cobbler builds actual dnsmasq configuration file 
``/etc/dnsmasq.conf`` from template ``/etc/cobbler/dnsmasq.template``. That is 
why you should not edit ``/etc/dnsmasq.conf``.
Cobbler rewrites it each time when it is synchronized.

If you try to use virtual machines to launch Fuel then you have to be sure 
that dnsmasq on master node is configured to support that PXE client you use 
on your virtual machines. We enabled *dhcp-no-override* option because 
without it enabled dnsmasq tries to move out PXE filename and PXE servername 
special fields into DHCP options. Not all PXE implementations can understand 
those options and therefore they will not be able to boot. For example, 
Centos 6.3 uses gPXE implementation instead of more advanced iPXE by default.

When configuration is done
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the admin node is installed, power on all other nodes and open the Fuel 
on the configured network. Slave nodes will be booted in bootstrap mode 
(CentOS based Linux in memory) via PXE and you will see notifications on the 
user interface about discovered nodes. This is the point when you can create 
an environment, add nodes into it, and start configuration. Networking 
configuration is most complicated part, so please read the networking 
section of documentation carefully.
