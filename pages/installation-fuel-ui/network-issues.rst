.. index:: Fuel UI: Network Issues

Network Issues
==============

Fuel has a built-in capability to run network check before or after OpenStack 
deployment. Currently it can check connectivity between nodes within 
configured VLANs on configured server interfaces. Image below shows sample 
result of such check. By using this simple table it is easy to say which 
interfaces do not receive certain VLAN IDs. Usually it means that switch or 
multiple switches are not configured correctly and do not allow certain 
tagged traffic to pass through.

On VirtualBox
-------------

Scripts which are provided for quick Fuel setup, create 3 host-interface 
adapters. Basically networking works as this being a 3 bridges, in each of 
them the only one VMs interfaces is connected. It means there is only L2 
connectivity between VMs on interfaces with the same name. If you try to 
move, for example, management network to `eth1` on Controller node, and the 
same network to `eth2` on the Compute, then there will be no connectivity 
between OpenStack services in spite of being configured to live on the same 
VLAN. It is very easy to validate network settings before deployment by 
clicking the "Verify Networks" button.
If you need to access OpenStack REST API over Public network, VNC console of VMs,
Horizon in HA mode or VMs, refer to this section: :ref:`access_to_public_net`.

Timeout In Connection to OpenStack API From Client Applications
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you use Java, Python or any other code to work with OpenStack API, all 
connections should be done over OpenStack Public network. To explain why we 
can not use Fuel network, let's try to run nova client with debug 
option enabled::

  [root@controller-6 ~]# nova --debug list

Even though initial connection was in 192.168.0.2, then client tries to 
access Public network for Nova API. The reason is because Keystone returns 
the list of OpenStack services URLs, and for production-grade deployments it 
is required to access services over public network. 

.. seealso:: :ref:`access_to_public_net` if you want to configure the installation
  on VirtualBox to make all these issues fixed.
