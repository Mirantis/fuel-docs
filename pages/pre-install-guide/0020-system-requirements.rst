System Requirements
===================

Before you begin installation of Fuel, make sure your hardware meets 
or exceeds the following minimum requirements.

.. _HardwarePrerequisites:

Master Node Hardware Recommendations
------------------------------------

To install the Fuel Master Node, you should base your hardware on the 
anticipated load of your server. Logically, deploying more node servers in your 
environment requires more CPU, RAM, and disk performance.

Suggested minimum configuration for installation in production environment:

-  Quad-core CPU
-  4GB RAM
-  1 gigabit network port (2 required for Red Hat OpenStack)
-  128GB SAS Disk
-  IPMI access through independent management network

Suggested minumum configuration for installation in lab environment:

-  Dual-core CPU
-  2GB RAM
-  1 gigabit network port (2 required for Red Hat OpenStack)
-  50GB disk
-  Physical console access

Node Server Hardware Recommendations
------------------------------------

To help determine the correct sizing for OpenStack Node servers,
use the `Mirantis Hardware Bill of Materials
calculator <https://www.mirantis.com/openstack-services/bom-calculator/>`__.

For more information on the logic used in the utility and basic directions,

your OpenStack
cloud? <http://www.mirantis.com/blog/openstack-hardware-bom-calculator/>`__\ ”.
