Multi-node (HA) Deployment (Full)
=================================

For large production deployments, its more common to provide
dedicated hardware for storage. This architecture gives you the advantages of 
high availability, but this clean separation makes your cluster more 
maintainable by separating storage and controller functionality:

Where Fuel really shines is in the creation of more complex architectures, so 
in this document you'll learn how to use Fuel to easily create a multi-node HA 
OpenStack cluster. To reduce the amount of hardware you'll need to follow the 
installation, however, the guide focuses on the Multi-node HA Compact 
architecture.
