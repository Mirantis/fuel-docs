Cluster Sizing
==============

This reference architecture is well suited for production-grade
OpenStack deployments on a medium and large scale when you can afford
allocating several servers for your OpenStack controller nodes in
order to build a fully redundant and highly available environment.

The absolute minimum requirement for a highly-available OpenStack
deployment is to allocate 4 nodes:

- 3 controller nodes, combined with storage

- 1 compute node

  :align: center

If you want to run storage separately from the controllers, you can do that as 
well by raising the bar to 9 nodes:

- 3 Controller nodes

- 3 Storage nodes

- 2 Swift Proxy nodes

- 1 Compute node

Of course, you are free to choose how to deploy OpenStack based on the
amount of available hardware and on your goals (such as whether you
want a compute-oriented or storage-oriented environment).

For a typical OpenStack compute deployment, you can use this table as
high-level guidance to determine the number of controllers, compute,
and storage nodes you should have:
