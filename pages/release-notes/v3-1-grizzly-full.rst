What Is Fuel™?
==============
 
Fuel™ is the ultimate OpenStack Do-it-Yourself Kit. Purpose built to assimilate 
the hard-won experience of our services team, it contains the tooling, 
information, and support you need to accelerate time to production with 
OpenStack cloud. Fuel is designed to work with Puppet configuration management 
software, using Cobbler for bare metal provisioning.
   
Fuel automates provisioning and deployment of all core OpenStack components 
including Nova, Glance, Horizon, Swift, Keystone, Neutron (formerly Quantum) 
and Cinder, as well as key open source packages for components required to 
support High Availability deployment configurations, such as Galera, Pacemaker, 
Corosync, and HAProxy.
 
To help make the most of your time and resources, and to help tame the risk 
and complexity of managing dynamic OpenStack environments, Fuel features a 
streamlined, graphical console. Its intuitive interface controls deployment 
and provisioning of your OpenStack cloud, providing a point-and-click 
experience for the most commonly deployed configurations. If you are familiar 
with tools like Cobbler and Puppet and want maximum flexibility in your 
deployment, the command-line capabilities of the Fuel Library can also be used 
for automated deployment and configuration of your OpenStack infrastructure.
