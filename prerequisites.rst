Hardware Requirements
===========================
The amount of hardware depends on your deployment requirements. 
When you plan your OpenStack environment, consider the following:

* Processing
  
  Depends on the number of virtual machines that you plan to deploy
  in your cloud environment and the CPU per virtual machine.
  See :ref:'Calculating CPU Requirements'

* Memory
  
  Depends on the amount of RAM assigned per virtual machine and the
  controller node.
  
* Storage
 
  Depends on the local drive space per virtual machine, remote volumes
  that can be attached to a virtual machine, and object storage.

* Networking
  
  Depends on the OpenStack architecture, network bandwidth per virtual
  machine, and network storage.
